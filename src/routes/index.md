He currently serves as Director of Design at 18F, leading one of the largest experience design teams in federal government.

His practice is focused around Consequence Design which centers on interaction design harms (aka "dark patterns"), the intersection of technology in spatial experiences, and consumer advocacy in service delivery. He spent the past 4 years at GSA's 18F, most recently as head of one of the government's largest in-house design teams.

He was appointed by the Mayor to serve on the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission; was a member of several non-profit boards (AIGA Indy, IxDA) and even a community radio station.
