# Ron Bronson

<h2>I work at 18F. As Head of Design, I manage one of the largest in-house design teams in the federal government, deploying designers as part of cross-functional teams to collaborate with federal (and sometimes, state) agencies on improving service delivery.</h2>
<br />

Besides my "day job", you can find me traveling all over hither and yon talking about service design, the perils of friction in service delivery, and writing (slowly) on [Consequence Design](https://consequencedesign.org).

Prior to joining senior leadership at 18F, I served as a design manager, staffing lead, and individual contributor on engagements with agencies with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, Department of Defense, Federal Trade Commission, and others. 

Before joining the federal government, I spent years working across local & state government wearing a lot of hats, but mostly leading large-scale digital transformation projects. My core skills are information architecture, service design, UX research, and content strategy. 


Many moons ago, I also served in the U.S. Air Force.

<h3> Tennis Coaching </h3>

I've coached collegiate, scholarship, and summer tennis programs intermittently over the past two decades in Oregon, Colorado, Vermont & Connecticut. 

Right now, I'm Head Girls Varsity Tennis coach at Catlin Gabel School in Portland. Since taking over three seasons ago, we've won back-to-back conference titles & district championships. In 2022, we won the Oregon 4A/3A/2A/1A Tennis State title. (Which is pretty cool.) I was also voted District & Conference Coach of the Year. 

I played college & high school tennis and had a coach that changed my life. It inspired me to coach. [I talked about this on a podcast, once.](https://podcasts.apple.com/fi/podcast/2-mr-van-blake-pes%C3%A4pallo-consequence-design-with-ron/id1543988908?i=1000523670103)

I've also coached a few seasons of college debate (after competing in that activity in HS & college) too.

<h3> Volunteering </h3>

In 2021-22, I served on the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission, which mostly happened because I have an instagram that's just neon photos.

Other semi-interesting stuff I've done: I started Indianapolis Design Week in 2016 and ran it for two years, before transferring leadership. (It still exists!) I've run a few other design/tech events in the past, too. 

I've launched skeeball leagues in at least two cities, too. Also, I'm (probably) America's foremost authority on the [Finnish sport of Pes√§pallo.](https://www.superpesis.fi/uutiset/yhdysvaltalainen-ron-bronson-toteutti-unelmansa-ja-matkusti-suomeen-katsomaan-pesapalloa/) 

Speaking of sports, there's the time [we invented one](https://toccer.tumblr.com/). 

<!-- ## Get started

Get up and running with this site really fast! For an [opinionated
quickstart](/blog/initial-setup), you need to have

- clicked "use this template" in [GitHub]({variables.github}), so you have your own copy of
  this repository, and cloned it to your own computer
- set up a free account on Netlify ready for [deployment](/blog/deployment) (other static site hosting options
  are fine if you know how)
- thought about whether you are happy writing blog content in files in
  GitHub, or prefer to use a [CMS](/blog/cms) for web-based writing.
- thought about whether this template has the right site sections
  (home/blog/about) for you, or if you need extra pages

While this template is still under development, these docs assume that you:

- are vaguely familiar with basic git commands (clone, add, commit, push) and GitHub
- know how to edit HTML/JavaScript files on your computer (even if you don't fully
  understand what they mean)
- are able to set up a working NodeJS environment on your computer.

More comprehensive beginner documentation is coming soon, and if you get stuck feel free to [contact
us](mailto:hi@codexfelis.dev) for help or [raise an issue in GitHub]({variables.github}/issues).
